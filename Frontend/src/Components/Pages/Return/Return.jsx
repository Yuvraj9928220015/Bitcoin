                                At Bitcoin Butik, we take pride in the quality of our products and strive to ensure our customers are satisfied. However,
                                due to the high costs associated with small business operations and the nature of our products, we do not accept returns or exchanges.
                                This policy helps us keep our costs manageable and maintain fair prices for our customers. Please read our policy carefully before
                                making a purchase.
